When I was learning Git, I was particularly surprised by the large number of version control features. For example, interactive rebasing paves the way for a cleaner and more organized commit history by allowing you to reorder commits, merge them, or edit messages. Using stash proved useful for temporarily saving incomplete changes, allowing you to quickly switch between branches without losing progress. I was also impressed by the ability to roll back to any previous state of the project, which gives me confidence in experimenting and fixing.
